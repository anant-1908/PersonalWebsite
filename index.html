  <h2>A Collection of My Essays</h2><hr>

  <main>
    <p>Don't think of this as a blog. Think of this more as an 'idea refinery'. I examine interesting ideas and take notes on them. You might find some of mine too.</p>
    <p>
      If you're wondering why this site looks like a shitty internet website from the 2000s, it's because I lack CSS skills. 
      You will find ideas here that you disagree with, agree with, or couldn't care for. My objective here is to make you think about
      some of these ideas yourself. Some of the writings here are going to be quite personal. If you know me, there' a good chance
      you'll look at me differently, or may even start disliking me. That is fine. That is necessary. There are no conformist original
      thinkers. 
      Why exactly does this exist, and why do I call it an idea refinery? I want to think just as much
      as you do. 
      The reason I wanted to start this blog is because I want to think. Putting this in the public domain for anyone else to 
      read forces me to be cohesive.It also introduces my ideas to other people. However, I think I’m starting ‘this’ for myself,
      just as much as I’m putting it out here for a stray internet user to read. 
      A logical question that follows is: why not journal instead? The answer: thoughts are impermanent and spontaneous. 
      One of my friends called an unlisted video
      published on my YouTube: ‘a stream of consciousness. While I adore the sentiment with which she told me this, it is 
      precisely this ‘stream’ 
      that makes my thoughts unstructured. With a journal, I have no incentive to make any sense. There’s nothing 
      that ties the whole thing together.
      Publishing here, on the other hand, forces me to make some logical sense.<br><br><br>

    <div id="song"><i>Let me take you down<br>
      'Cause I'm going to strawberry fields<br>
      Nothing is real<br>
      And nothing to get hung about<br>
      Strawberry fields forever<br><br>
      Living is easy with eyes closed<br>
      Misunderstanding all you see<br>
      It's getting hard to be someone, but it all works out<br>
      It doesn't matter much to me<br><br>
      Let me take you down<br>
      'Cause I'm going to strawberry fields<br>
      Nothing is real<br>
      And nothing to get hung about<br>
      Strawberry fields forever<br><br>
      No one I think is in my tree<br>
      I mean, it must be high or low<br>
      That is, you can't, you know, tune in, but it's alright<br>
      That is, I think it's not too bad<br><br>
      Let me take you down<br>
      'Cause I'm going to strawberry fields<br>
      Nothing is real<br>
      And nothing to get hung about<br>
      Strawberry fields forever<br><br>
      Always, no sometimes, think it's me<br>
      But you know, I know when it's a dream<br>
      I think I know, I mean a yes<br>
      But it's all wrong<br>
      That is, I think I disagree<br><br>
      Let me take you down<br>
      'Cause I'm going to strawberry fields<br>
      Nothing is real<br>
      And nothing to get hung about<br>
      Strawberry fields forever<br>
